Description Of Corpus:
Every day, thousands of companies and individuals turn to LinkedIn in search of talent. This dataset contains a nearly comprehensive record of 124,000+ job postings listed in 2023 and 2024. Each individual posting contains dozens of valuable attributes for both postings and companies, including the title, job description, salary, location, application URL, and work-types (remote, contract, etc), in addition to separate files containing the benefits, skills, and industries associated with each posting. The majority of jobs are also linked to a company, which are all listed in another csv file containing attributes such as the company description, headquarters location, and number of employees, and follower count.

With so many datapoints, the potential for exploration of this dataset is vast and includes exploring the highest compensated titles, companies, and locations; predicting salaries/benefits through NLP; and examining how industries and companies vary through their internship offerings and benefits. Future updates will permit further exploration into time-based trends, including company growth, prevalence of remote jobs, and demand of individual job titles over time.
